# The Anti-Exploitation License

---
## What is the Anti-Exploitation License?
The Anti-Exploitation License (AEL) is based on and derived from the ["i'm so tired" software license](https://olmewe.com/notepad/istsl/) and the license that it is based on, the [Anti-Capitalist Software License](https://anticapitalist.software/). This license exists to release projects for the benefit of individuals, collectives, worker-owned cooperatives, and nonprofits, while denying usage to those that exploit labor for profit and those who spread bigotry or fascist ideals, or otherwise cause harm to humankind.

The AEL includes 6 licenses created from a common template.

## How is the Anti-Exploitation License different from other licenses?
The AEL aims to put the rights and wellbeing of people at the forefront while retaining some of the considerations of open source and copyleft licenses. It is not the only license to do so.

## Why not open source / copyleft?
The Anti-Exploitation License is a copyfair license, not an open source license. It does not allow unrestricted use by all entities in all conditions, because doing so allows work to be exploited for malicious purposes.

The AEL does not release your project to the public domain or creative commons. The AEL does not require derived source material to be made available. You may choose to add these conditions to your work if desired.

The AEL claims that copyleft and/or open source requirements are not universally good. The AEL allows integration into closed-source projects without requiring those projects to be made open-source.

## Why commercial / noncommercial use?
Commerce and capitalism are not the same thing. Commercialization of AEL projects is allowed, provided the organizations and individuals that do so do not operate in a capitalist manner and do not engage in harmful activities, as defined in the license.

The AEL is intended to allow works to exist in spite of capitalism and other harmful practices rather than under them, and to prevent works from being used to widen imbalances of power.

## Why attribution / nonattribution?
Different people value being credited for their work differently. People may prefer derivatives of their work to attribute their original work where others may prefer they do not or may have no preference. The AEL aims to account for these preferences.

## Is this license right for my project?
In general, the AEL is a good fit for projects that may have otherwise used permissive licenses such as MIT, BSD, Apache, Creative Commons, or other similar licenses, but with restrictions against unethical usage.

The AEL may be right for you if you want your project to empower students, artists, hobbyists, collectives, cooperatives, and nonprofits to benefit from their own work without contributing free labor to corporations or providing tools to be used for harm.

The AEL may be right for you if you acknowledge that we need to survive under the flawed systems that exist, but believe that better systems are possible.

The AEL may be right for you if you believe that the moral and ethical use of your work is more important than making its source material available.

## Is this actually enforceable?
This license has not been tested in court, although using AEL projects against their terms would open the user to litigation. The AEL should be considered as a deterrent and as a way to state the principles, ethics, politics, and morals of your work.

## What if this license doesnâ€™t fit my needs?
The AEL was built in response to, and out of, other licenses. You are permitted and encouraged to adapt, expand, or edit the language of the AEL to meet the needs of your project, or to use it as a starting place for something new, provided that you abide by the terms of the AEL's own license. There is also a list of licenses with similar directives at the bottom of this page, which might provide exactly what you need.
